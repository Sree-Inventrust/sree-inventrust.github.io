 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>The memory of the first time I saw you is still fresh as it had just happened yesterday. One of the most important days in my life and it will not fade away.</p> 

<p>I remember every little detail of the day, how you walked in to the room like a graceful peahen (or should I say "stormed into my life"), the way you sat there like a beautiful swan. It was all blissfull, since then my life has been blissfull. The day began with thousand questions in my mind, but the moment I saw you, I knew the One most important answer "I wanted to live the rest of my life with you". That's how the story began.....</p>
